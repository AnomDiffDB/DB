## Single particle diffusion characterization by deep learning

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper:
[Single particle diffusion characterization by deep learning.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349519305041)

The network models and functions provided here are used to classify single particle anomalous diffusion trajectories to one of three models:
- Fractional Brownian motion
- Continuous time random walk
- Pure Brownian motion

And in addition, to extract the Hurst exponent for Fractional Brownian Motion trajectories.

Instructions on how to run the code can be found in the Instructions file.
